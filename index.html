          <h5 class="aboutme"><i class="material-icons">assignment_ind</i>About Me</h5>
            <p>I'm an Analog Engineer that decided to pursue the digital world. 
              As someone who has worked with everything from web development to pure analog systems, I like to think of myself as a truly FULL stack engineer. I like to work on projects that allow me to use electrical and computer engineering skills, such as the internet of things, robotics, and software defined radio. 
              <br><br>
              I am currently seeking opportunities for when I graduate
              in May 2016.

            My research centers around visualizing and controlling a
            cognitive radio based wireless sensor network in Unity3D. I
            am working as part of a small team on all aspects of the
            project. My current focus is on using GNU Radio and USRP
            Software Defined Radios to establish the network. Once
            this is completed, I will pivot and work on controlling and
            visualizing the radios in Unity3D.

            <br><br>
            I have also developed an open source driver in python to
            communicate with the Robopeak LIDAR and worked with
            the Unity3D game engine to visualize the LIDAR point
            cloud.

            I have helped coordinate and acted as
            a mentor at multiple hardware based hackathon type events we dubbed 
            "protothons". I have lead numerous recitations. I have had 
            the opportunity to help with Circuits I, Circuits I Lab, 
            Intro to Engineering, Intro to Engineering Design, and  
            Intro to Programming. I have also helped with the 
            school's diversity club.

            <br><br>
            Tivoli Audio is a consumer electronics company located in
            Boston, MA. It is a small company with a start-up style
            culture. I participated in the development of over 10 new
            products from ideation to final assembly. I generated both
            analog and digital designs for the products. I prototyped
            many of the products and I created BOM's and ECR
            reports to assist in the transition from prototypes to
            production ready products.
            <br><br>
            While working for Tivoli Audio, I spent about 15% of my
            time in China helping to address manufacturing issues.
            Though my background at the time was mostly analog, I
            became more interested in microcontrollers and the
            "Internet of Things". I left the company to attend graduate
            school.

            As an intern for the Theater Deployable Communications branch of MITRE
            my research focused on how software based VoIP phones could be 
            integrated into the current Air Force infrastructure. 
            <br><br>
            My work
            allowed me to utilize  Wireshark, Backtrack 5 (now Kali),
            Cisco switches, and other network testing equipment. I learned a lot
            about security and got to work on Hanscom Airforce Base. My work culminated
            in the publication of a white paper and a presentation at a MITRE technical
            exchange meeting with various members of the United States Armed Forces
            ranking as high as Colonel.
