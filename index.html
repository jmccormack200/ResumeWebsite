          <h5 class="aboutme"><i class="material-icons">assignment_ind</i>About Me</h5>
            <p>I'm an Analog Engineer that decided to pursue the digital world. 
              Currently, I am a Computer Engineering graduate student in Florida Polytechnic University's Inaugural Class.
              My research has allowed me to pursue web development through Internet of Things Projects.
              I have also continued to learn about hardware through wireless sensor networks and
              software defined radio research.
              <br><br>
              Our research has allowed me to do a lot of hands on
              hacking with Unity3D to do more than just create games. 
              I have a love for robotics. Being in its second year of operation,
              Florida Polytechnic has a "start up" culture to it where everyone wears multiple hats. This has allowed
              me to pursue a number of topics while I'm here. I am currently seeking opportunities for when I graduate
              in May 2016.

          I play piano, drums, marimba, and ukulele.
          I have recently purchased a banjo and I 
          absolutely love the instrument. 

          I also enjoy cinematography and video production.
          All in all I love my field and often find 
          learning a new language just as relaxing as 
          watching a movie.

			As a graduate research assistant I get to work with all sorts of cutting edge 
			equipment. My research centers around visualizing and controlling a cognitive 
			radio based wireless sensor network in Unity3D. I am working as part of a small 
			team and get to work on all aspects of the project. I am working on using 
			GNURadio and USRP Software Defined Radios to establish the network. 
			Once this is completed, I will pivot and work on controlling and 
			visualizing the radios in Unity3D. 
            <br><br>
            I have also developed an open source driver in python to communicate 
            with the Robopeak LIDAR and worked with the Unity3D game engine to 
            visualize the LIDAR point cloud. As Florida Polytechnic is a small 
            school, I have also helped in establishing the VTC Lab and Electronics 
            shop. I have helped generate proposals and purchased equipment in order to
            give other students the necessary tools and equipment they need to continue 
            research and coursework. I also contributed to a proposal development for a 
            Protothon lab event, funded 2015.

            Since joining Florida Polytechnic I've had the opportunity to help 
            prepare quizzes, exams, lectures, and homework assignments in 
            conjunction with the instructor. I have helped coordinate and acted as
            a mentor at multiple hardware based hackathon type events we dubbed 
            "protothons". I have lead numerous recitations. I have had 
            the opportunity to help with Circuits I, Circuits I Lab, 
            Intro to Engineering, Intro to Engineering Design, and  
            Intro to Programming. I have also helped with the 
            school's diversity club.

            <br><br>
            Tivoli Audio is a consumer electronics company located
            in Boston, MA. Though Tivoli has been around for awhile,
            they are a small company with a start-up style culture. 
            I got my hands on all aspects of the design from ideation, to
            final assembly. I participated in the development of over
            10 new products in my time there. I prototyped many of the products and
            I created BOM's and ECR reports to assist in the transition from
            prototype to production ready product. I spent about 15% of my time
            there in China helping to address manufacturing issues. I 
            generated both analog and digital designs for the products. Though 
            my background at the time was mostly analog, this was where 
            I began to become more interested in microcontrollers and 
            the "Internet of Things". This curiosity ultimately lead
            me to leave the company to attend graduate school.

            <br><br>
            As an intern for the Theater Deployable Communications branch of MITRE
            my research focused on how software based VoIP phones could be 
            integrated into the current Air Force infrastructure. My work
            allowed me to utilize  Wireshark, Backtrack 5 (now Kali),
            Cisco switches, and other network testing equipment. I learned a lot
            about security and got to work on Hanscom Airforce Base. My work culminated
            in the publication of a white paper and a presentation at a MITRE technical
            exchange meeting with various members of the United States Armed Forces
            ranking as high as Colonel.
